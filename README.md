# Competitive_Practice
(Aj's Competitive programming Repo)

This is my new Repo.

I didn't make a new one because its time consuming.

Now, im going to focus more on being competitive from now on including the web repos.

i like this thing.

Its like i feel im in a hackathon.

Its so sweet and i love to make it a go for it.

Well i do have knowledge for some algorithms and questions.

I REALLY WANT TO GO FOR IT!

I want to be in it and make apps in minutes.

i meant solutions in minutes.

pardon me, im just excited because i just know how things work and how to make it better

I just knew it and i wanted to find it within my curiosity.

I'll be using C++ so it make take a little while to practice.

I hae stock knowledge about c++ so i might have a little time for getting the hang of it in a few hours.

C# with Xojo. 

Golang with javascript. 

and C++ for mostly everything.

The trinity for coding is now complete.

Feel free to see my pratice in this repo.
