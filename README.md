# Competitive_Practice
(Aj's Competitive programming Repo)

This is my competitive programming Repo.

I think i would stay on learning javascript for a long time.

it would take me months to go back to golang.

I saw tons of Sources here and I am really learning a lot.

I thought of making algorithms for a while.

I had a hobby of Learning data science back then.

Well i do have a decade of experince making recommended items for games.

I have learned the ways in making AI before.

I literally dont make AI back then but i did know how these things work.

I learned appreciating robots,card games,etc.

I have learned how to be strategic within the years.

I want to try being competitive and show my view.

I like algorithms so much so i make things different.

My answers are quite different and people will see how i view things differently.

i want to make things simple as practice as you know what they say.

the Simpler the programs the more experienced the programmer.
